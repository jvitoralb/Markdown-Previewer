export const keywordsText = `### A Markdown previewer.  
Here are some helpful keywords:

\`#\` For the bigger header.

\`##\` For the subheader.

\`###\` For the smaller one.

If you want a new paragraph, leave an empty line.

Use double-space  
to brake a line.

Write between \` \`\` \` to write in-line code

For a codeblock write \` \`\`\` \` to open and write your code
and then to close use also three backticks.

To make lists:
- Use \`-\` for Unordered
2. Use \`1.\` for Unordered
    - Can use any number before a \`.\`
    - For nested lists use \`-\` right below the first letter of the first word in the item above.

To attach links [Write the word inside brackects](and the URL in parenthesis).

If you want to insert images:  
![Use the same pattern as](for the links) with \`!\`, before the brackets.`;
