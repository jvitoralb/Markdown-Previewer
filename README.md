## This is a Markdown Previewer

[To see the project live click here](https://jvitoralb.github.io/Markdown-Previewer/)!

This project is part of the Front End Development Libraries certification course for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
In this project, I used JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Sass to change some default Bootstrap variables.
Also used the Marked library to parse Markdown.

The main goal of this project was to practice Bootstrap and Sass.

In the `main.js` file, you can find all the JS logic to make the project work,
and in the `defaultTexts.js` file, you find some texts that are rendered with marked, so the main JavaScript file is organized.
