## This is a Markdown Previewer

This project is part of the Front End Development Libraries certification course for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.  
In this project, I used JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Saas to change some default Bootstrap variables.  
Also used Marked library to parse Markdown.

The main goal of this project was to practice the Bootstrap and Saas.

In the `main.js` file you can find all the JS logic to make the project work,  
and in the `defaultTexts.js` file you find some texts that are rendered with marked, so the main JavaScript file is organized.
